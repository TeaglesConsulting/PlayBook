The key to data collection and analysis is recognizing what information within the client's domain is most valuable to their business. We should research the focus of our client's website and how it enhances their business. If our client's website displays products, allows customers to add products to a cart, and make purchases then we can make serveral observations:

- "Success" for this client is revenue generated by a customer completing an order on the website.
- "Success" for this client has many steps.
  1. Customer visits website.
  2. Customer view products.
  3. Customer puts product into cart.
  4. Customer begins checkout.
  5. Customer completes checkout successfully.
- Tracking each step, in addition to "success" may be useful in optimizing our client's website.
- Generating more completed orders will impact our client in the most positive way.
